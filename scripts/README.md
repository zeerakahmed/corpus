This directory contains a set of scripts to conduct common analyses on the text corpus. These serve as a good starting point on how to build further scripts.

## How these scripts are structured

The collection of scripts is structured as a Swift package. You can read more about Swift packages [here](https://swift.org/package-manager/). 

While Swift is not the most common language for natural language processing, it was chosen due to a dependency on the [Naqqash package](http://github.com/zeerakahmed/naqqash) which provides necessary methods to process text in the Arabic script. Both the Naqqash package and this text repository were built in the service of [Matnsaz](https://matnsaz.net), an Urdu keyboard.

The `Package.swift` file contains the names of executables and lists dependencies. If you create a new script, add a target to this file. The `/Sources` directory contains executables which each perform separate analyses. Output from these analyses is stored in `../stats`. 

## How to run

To build the scripts on your machine, `cd` to this package directory and then run `swift build`. To run a script, identify the target you want to run by running `swift run <target>`. For example if you wanted to run the `wordFrequency` script, you would run it as `swift run wordFrequency`

## Sample scripts included

Each script can be found in the [`/Sources`](/Sources) directory.
- The `preProcessor` executable goes through each character in every file, and decomposes it into multiple Unicode codepoints if needed.
- The `wordFrequency` executable counts how often each word appears in the full corpus. Text in non-Urdu languages and metadata is ignored for this count.
